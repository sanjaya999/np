# Project Summary

## Overview
The project appears to be a Java-based application that deals with networking and URL handling. It includes various classes for creating client-server architectures, handling cookies, and managing IP addresses. The use of Java indicates that the project is likely focused on building network applications, possibly including both HTTP and custom protocols.

### Languages, Frameworks, and Main Libraries Used
- **Language**: Java
- **Frameworks**: None explicitly mentioned, but standard Java libraries are likely used for networking and URL handling.
- **Main Libraries**: 
  - Java Networking (java.net)
  - Java IO (java.io)

## Purpose of the Project
The primary purpose of the project seems to be the implementation of client-server communication, with functionalities that include:
- Echoing messages between clients and servers.
- Handling HTTP requests and responses.
- Managing cookies for session handling.
- Resolving URLs and managing IP address formats.
